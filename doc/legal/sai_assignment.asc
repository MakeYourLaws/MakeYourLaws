COPYRIGHT ASSIGNMENT

For good and valuable consideration, receipt of which I acknowledge, I, Sai aka saizai, hereby transfer to Make Your Laws ("MYL") my entire right, title, and interest (including all rights under copyright) in my changes and enhancements to the Make Your Laws project, subject to the conditions below. These changes and enhancements are herein called the "Work." The work hereby assigned shall also include any future revisions of these changes and enhancements hereafter made by me.

MYL grants me permanent, non-exclusive rights to use the Work (i.e. my changes and enhancements, not the program which I enhanced) as I see fit; the MYL's rights shall otherwise continue unchanged.

For the purposes of this contract, a work "based on the Work" means any work that in whole or in part incorporates or is derived from all or part of the Work.

MYL promises that all distribution of the Work, or of any work "based on the Work," that takes place under the control of MYL or its assignees, shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply, and possessing accurate notice of these terms, to redistribute copies of the work to anyone on the same terms. These terms shall not restrict which members of the public copies may be distributed to. These terms shall not require a member of the public to pay any royalty to MYL or to anyone else for any permitted use of the work they apply to, or to communicate with MYL or its agents in any way either when redistribution is performed or on any other occasion.

MYL promises that any program "based on the Work" offered to the public by MYL or its assignees shall be offered in the form of machine-readable source code, in addition to any other forms of MYL's choosing. However, MYL is free to choose at its convenience the media of distribution for machine-readable source code.

MYL promises to make available to me without any request required, as with any member of the public, an online copy of any or all of the works "based on the Work" that it offers to the public or that it has offered within the past six months, or that it distributed for the first time within the past six months. For works that are programs, the machine-readable source code shall be included.

I hereby agree that if I have or acquire hereafter any patent or interface copyright or other intellectual property interest dominating the program enhanced by the Work (or use of that program), such dominating interest will not be used to undermine the effect of this assignment, i.e. MYL and the general public will be licensed to use, in that program and its derivative works, without royalty or limitation, the subject matter of the dominating interest. This license provision will be binding on my heirs, assignees, or other successors to the dominating interest, as well as on me.

I hereby represent and warrant that I am the sole copyright holder for the Work and that I have the right and power to enter into this contract. 

I hereby indemnify and hold harmless MYL, its officers, employees, and agents against any and all claims, actions or damages (including attorney's reasonable fees) asserted by or paid to any party on account of a breach or alleged breach of the foregoing warranty. I make no other express or implied warranty (including without limitation, in this disclaimer of warranty, any warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE).

Agreed: Sai, 28 November 2011
