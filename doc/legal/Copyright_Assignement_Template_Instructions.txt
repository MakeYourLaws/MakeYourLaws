This is a template contract closely based on the FSF's. 

Signing it is required of *all* code and design contributors to the Make Your Laws project.

Alternately, you can create an independent project (e.g. a library or plugin), release it under any AGPL-compatible license you like, and let us know.


To do so:
1. Pick the correct version, based on the employer release required:
a) you have no employer with competing interest to your work whose permission you need to execute the assignment yourself
b) you do, but they can't PGP sign, so you are swearing that they gave you permission
c) you do, and they're PGP signing their own part

2. Make a copy of it into /doc/legal/yourname_assignment.asc

3. Search for all instances of a [[KEYWORD]] and replace them as appropriate. Please note that a legal name can be a "doing business as", "fictitious business name", or common-law name, not necessarily only the name on government ID - but it must be a name that you can use to legally sign contracts.

4. versions A & B: Clear sign (ASCII armored) the entire document.
version C: Clear sign the assignment portion and have the employer's representative clearsign that portion.

If you have more than one employer who may have a competing interest, repeat the employer release for each.

5. Commit the assignment as part of your first pull request. An appropriate MYL rep will countersign it.
