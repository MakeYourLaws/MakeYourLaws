<h3>Make Your Laws is launching soon.</h3>

<p>When we do, you will be able to use this website to easily make all kinds of political contributions, using <%= link_to "flexible tools", fec_earmarks_path %> that empower normal people and transparently use the trust and advice relationships they already have.</p>

<p>This is our <%= link_to "first step", strategy_path %> towards our ultimate goal of making every legislature a <%= link_to "liquid democracy", introduction_path %> â€” one where you can participate as much you want, collaboratively author new legislation, have your values be accurately represented on every issue, and truly <em>make your laws</em>.</p>

<h3>Interested?</h3>

<p>If you <%= link_to "create an account", signup_path %>, we'll give you early access to the beta version.</p>
