<li>
	<p>Are you a PAC? Super PAC? Non profit?</p>
	<p>All of the above, actually. We are incorporated as three separate but collaborating non-profit corporations:
	<ol>
		<li>Make Your Laws PAC, Inc. (MYL PAC), a 527 hybrid Super PAC, handles candidate-related issues, like contributions to federal and state candidates or parties.</li>
		<li>Make Your Laws Advocacy, Inc. (MYL C4), a 501(c)4, handles non-candidate-related advocacy issues, like contributions to voter initiative committees.</li>
		<li>Make Your Laws Inc. (MYL C3), a 501(c)3, handles non-partisan, non-contribution-related issues, like voter education, forum creation, etc.</li>
	</ol></p>
	<p>Of the three, only MYL C4 is currently active; the other two are waiting on advice from the FEC for how to handle a variety of organizational and financial issues.</p>
