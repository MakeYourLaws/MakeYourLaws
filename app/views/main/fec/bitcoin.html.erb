<h1>Bitcoin contributions to PACs</h1>

<p>On August 13th, Conservative Action Fund PAC <a href="http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1245451.pdf" target="_blank">asked</a> the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) about whether it should be allowed to accept Bitcoins. <a href="http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1246139.pdf" target="_blank">BitPay</a> and the <a href="http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/1246138.pdf" target="_blank">Bitcoin Foundation</a> commented on the request, and the FEC posted a <a href="http://saos.nictusa.com/aodocs/201315.pdf" target="_blank">draft advisory opinion</a>.</p>

<p>On November 12th, we formally <a href="/files/MYL%20PAC%20&%20MYL%20C4%20comment%20on%20AO%202013-15%20Conservative%20Action%20Fund.pdf" target="_blank">submitted a comment</a>. <span class="light">(The previous link is the original document.
