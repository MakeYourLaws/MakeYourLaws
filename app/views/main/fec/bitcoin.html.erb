	<%= link_to "Our request", fec_bitcoin_aor_path, :target => 'blank' %> | <a href="#drafts">Drafts &amp; our response</a> | <a href="#docs">Official docs</a> | <%= link_to "Orgs taking BTC", fec_bitcoin_pacs_path %> | <%= link_to "Previous BTC AOR", fec_bitcoin_caf_path%>
</p>

<p>Recently, the FEC <%= link_to "was asked to consider", fec_bitcoin_caf_path %> whether <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoins</a> should be allowed in political contributions. Because the PAC requesting to use Bitcoins wasn't able to explain how they would know who made the contributions, the FEC ultimately deadlocked on their <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/ao.shtml" target="_blank">advisory opinion</a> request (AOR). In the meantime, other political committees are <%= link_to "already accepting Bitcoin", fec_bitcoin_pacs_path %>, without any guidelines for how to do so properly.</p>

<p>We strongly believe that campaign finance needs to be done in a transparent, auditable, and responsible manner. We also want to give our users the ability to make political contributions using Bitcoin.</p>

<p>In order to set an example for how this can be done responsibly, on February 10<sup>th</sup> 2014, <%= link_to "Make Your Laws PAC", faq_path %> (MYL PAC) submitted a new request, proposing how we intend to accept Bitcoins.</p>

<p>Because of the legal context of this request, we can only ask the FEC to approve our own activity; we can't ask them to impose <em>requirements</em> on other political committees. However, if we are successful in getting the FEC's approval for our method, it's likely that other political committees will adopt the same policy.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of <%= link_to "our proposal", fec_bitcoin_aor_path, :target => 'blank' %>:
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Receiving Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>We will only receive Bitcoins online (i.e. no "physical" Bitcoins), <em>after</em> the contributor provides their information, and only through a "one-time linked address" system that makes it harder to contribute in someone else's name.</li>
				<li>We will keep records of all Bitcoin-specific transaction details (much like the records kept for check or credit card contributions).</li>
				<li>We won't accept any Bitcoins or Bitcoin-derived contributions from any "issue advocacy" (501(c)4) organization.</li>
				<li>Both the "traditional" and "SuperPAC" sides of MYL PAC (which is a "hybrid" SuperPAC) will follow the same rules. Bitcoin contributions will be separated the same as any other assets (e.g. with separate "contribution" vs "independent expenditure" wallets).</li>
				<li>We will refund Bitcoins in USD only, for contributors who have identified themselves to us. (Our request <a href="#other">doesn't address</a> anonymous contributions.)</li>
				<li>We won't accept more than $100 worth of Bitcoin (per contributor, per election), because even with our proposed accounting methods, Bitcoin's auditability is more like <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/110.4#c">cash contributions</a> than like contributions mediated by banks.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Spending Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>We <em>won't</em> directly spend Bitcoins for solicitation, advertising, polling, transfers, loans, refunds, candidate appearances, or political contributions (including transfers to other PACs). Instead, we'll liquidate them to US dollars first.</li>
				<li>We <em>will</em> spend Bitcoins for administrative/overhead expenses (including normal transaction fees to anonymous Bitcoin miners), salary, travel, campaign materials, and campaign event expenses (not including payments to candidates).</li>
				<li>We will accept merchants' Bitcoin-specific discounts (if they're offered equally to non-political clients).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<a name="c4"></a>
<h2><a href="#c4">Why different treatment for some types of spending and contributions?</a></h2>

<p>A 501(c)4 is only supposed to do "issue advocacy" (e.g. "Yes on Proposition X" type campaigns, lobbying, etc). In doing so, they are allowed to accept totally anonymous money. By contrast, PACs affect political elections, and anyone doing so is required to only use money from openly disclosed, non-foreign sources.</p>

<p>There's currently a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.284.29">giant loophole</a> in that system which lets 501(c)4s effectively bypass that restriction and give up to half of their assets to a SuperPAC, which can then use the money to run political ads — even though the ultimate contributors aren't reported and might not even be legally allowed to influence US elections. (The IRS is <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;D=IRS-2013-0038" target="_blank">currently considering closing</a> this loophole.) Because 501(c)4 contributions may ultimately originate from a totally anonymous third party or a foreign national, especially in the case of Bitcoin, we believe that a PAC shouldn't accept any Bitcoin contributions from a 501(c)4.</p>

<p>We feel that it should be fine for a PAC to use Bitcoin to buy food, pay salaries, and other relatively less sensitive items — but that money spent on advertising, political contributions, etc., should go through better regulated, traditional banking channels, which are easier to audit when necessary.</p>

<a name="other"></a>
<h2><a href="#other">What we <em>didn't</em> cover</a></h2>

<p>In order to simplify this request, we decided <em>not</em> to include a few things that we'd like to see addressed:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>We believe that Bitcoin contributions that are anonymous, suspicious, or illegal for a PAC to accept should be given to the US Treasury, or to a 501(c)4 or 501(c)3 (which, unlike PACs, are allowed to take totally anonymous contributions and contributions from foreign nationals). However, <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/103.3#b">current FEC regulations</a> require even clearly illegal contributions to be returned to the contributor.</p>
		<p>It is not currently possible to reliably return Bitcoins to the control of the person who sent them, and we believe it is more ethical to give illegal campaign finance contributions to an entity allowed to take anonymous contributions than to return them.</p>
		<p>Even worse, it is impossible to prevent totally anonymous Bitcoin users from sending us Bitcoins <em>outside</em> of our system for getting information on contributors. Any such contributions would be both illegal for us to possess and impossible to return, so we believe we should be allowed to give them to an entity allowed to accept unlimited anonymous contributions.</p></li>
	<li><p>We believe that 501(c)4s <em>can</em> accept unlimited, completely anonymous Bitcoin contributions, so long as they are only used for genuine issue advocacy (or contribution to charity) and <em>never</em>, directly or indirectly, used to influence the election of any politician.</p></li>
	<li><p>We believe that some unusual and/or malicious Bitcoin contributions (e.g. ones that are <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=278122.0">more expensive to spend</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/bitcoin-wallet/wiki/DustTransactions">than they're worth</a>) shouldn't be counted at all.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>We intend to raise some of these issues in a future AOR, when we have a specific situation to address (e.g. if we receive an anonymous Bitcoin contribution). Some issues (like refunds or a cap on the total amount given) might be addressable through an "as applied" interpretation of existing regulations, or might require regulatory or legal changes.</p>


<a name="drafts"></a>
<h2><a href="#drafts">FEC's draft opinions and our comments on them</a></h2>

<p>The FEC has so far issued two drafts, <a href="http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/201402.pdf">A</a> and <a href="http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/201402_1.pdf">B</a>. We <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/125Oyen0EdpVQ_uWWyO5licLbukxoaijcD0ykteLhG5Q/edit">filed comments</a> on both. Here's a summary of the major points; please read the full docs for details.

<ol>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/201402.pdf">Draft A</a></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We may accept and refund Bitcoins per our policy above.</li>
			<li>Bitcoins may be treated as in-kind contributions.</li>
			<li>We may both hold and buy Bitcoins.</li>
			<li>We may expend Bitcoin per our policy above, but only from Bitcoins we receive as contributions and hold unliquidated — not from Bitcoins we purchase.</li>
			<li>Bitcoin is valued at either at the market price at the time of transaction or at the actual price given by our Bitcoin processor (if converted to currency "contemporaneously").</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="http://saos.fec.gov/aodocs/201402_1.pdf">Draft B</a></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>We may accept and refund Bitcoins per our policy above.</li>
			<li>Bitcoins are not currency <em>per se</em>, but must be treated like currency contributions.</li>
			<li>We may not hold Bitcoin and must immediately convert it to currency held in a depository institution (e.g. a bank). However, we may buy Bitcoins for investment purposes.</li>
			<li>We may not make direct expenditures with Bitcoin at all.</li>
			<li>Bitcoin is valued at the market price at the time we first receive notice of the authorization or completed transfer (even if it changes price between receipt and contemporaneous liquidation).</li>
			<li>Bitcoin contributions <em>must</em> be subject to our proposed $100 limit.</li>
			<li>We must dispose of un-identified Bitcoin contributions to permitted recipients (e.g. a 501(c)4, 501(c)3, or the US Treasury).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/125Oyen0EdpVQ_uWWyO5licLbukxoaijcD0ykteLhG5Q/edit">Our comments on drafts A and B</a></h3>
		<ul>
			<li><h3>Differences between the two drafts</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Bitcoin is cash-like in terms of difficulty to audit, but definitely <em>not</em> currency/cash/money; it's more like gold or silver pieces. Treating it as "cash" more broadly would be very problematic (see our <%= link_to "comments on the previous Bitcoin AOR", fec_bitcoin_caf_path %>, first comment, p 7-8).</p>
						<p>Our proposed compromise: we should be <em>required</em> to have the $100 limit (as in B), but allowed to expend non-liquidated contributions and treat Bitcoin as an in-kind contribution (as in A).</p>
						<p>A further compromise could be made by limiting Bitcoin <em>expenditures</em> to $100 too (like the limit on <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/11/102.11">petty cash</a>).</p></li>
					<li>We prefer A's valuation method; B's clause for disposal of unidentified contributions; and B's reporting method for immediate conversions.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li><h3>Other issues with both drafts</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The opinion should use the term "virtual currency" to describe Bitcoin, not "currency", since the latter would be confusing (it's not accurate and is a legally defined term in the FECA).</li>
					<li>We should always be allowed to pay normal <a href="http://bitcoinfees.com">transaction fees</a> (including to anonymous Bitcoin miners), in Bitcoin.</li>
					<li>We should be allowed to deduct the cost of making a refund (e.g. of an excessive donation) from the refund itself, and if that's more than the refund, dispose of it to a c4/c3/etc.</li>
					<li>We should be allowed to deduct the cost of processing an <%= link_to "earmarked", fec_earmarks_path(anchor: 'earmarks') %> contribution from the amount we disburse to the recipient (since we're not the ones even receiving the money).</li>
					<li>We shouldn't have to connect a sale of Bitcoin to specific contributions, since that might not even be possible.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

<a name="comment"></a>
<h2><a href="#comment">How you can get involved</a></h2>

<p>We want to know what you think, and the FEC does too.</p>

<p>To tell us informally, just email <a href="mailto:team@makeyourlaws.org?subject=Comments%20on%20bitcoin%20AOR">team@makeyourlaws.org</a> or comment on the <%= link_to "Google doc", fec_bitcoin_aor_path, :target => 'blank' %>.</p>

<p>If you <%= link_to "create an account", signup_path %>, we'll also let you know when we launch the Make Your Laws democratized campaign finance website and invite you to the beta. (What you see now is only a placeholder.)</p>

<br/>

<p>To tell the FEC, just email <a href="mailto:ao@fec.gov?subject=Comments%20AO%202014-02">ao@fec.gov</a> or fax the FEC's Secretary at +1 (202) 208-3333 and Office of General Counsel at +1 (202) 219-3923.

<p>Give your name (and the name of any organization you represent), and mention the formal name of our request ("AO 2014-02"). Be clear and polite — explain both how you believe Bitcoins should (or shouldn't) be treated in campaign finance, and why.</p>

<p>If you can, it's better to make a more formal-looking comment. General email comments usually get lumped together, whereas if you take a little extra time to make a good-looking PDF and explain your reasoning in more detail, it'll appear separately and be looked at more seriously. There are no mandatory formatting requirements, but we suggest you use 12 pt Arial w/ 1.5 line spacing for body text; 1 inch margin; and have a header saying "(your [group's] name) comments on AO 2014-02" &amp; the page # / # total pages.</p>
