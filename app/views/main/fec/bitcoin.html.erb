<%= t "Bitcoin contributions to PACs" %>

<div class="flash notice l">Our request has been officially submitted, but hasn't yet been posted on the FEC website. We expect that it'll be AO 2013-20, but that number might turn out to be different (if someone else's request gets added before ours).</div>

<p>In August 2013, Conservative Action Fund PAC (CAF) asked the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) for an advisory opinion request (AOR) about whether they should be permitted to accept contributions of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>We commented on that request extensively (see <a href="#caf">below</a>), raising several issues with it that CAF failed to address. Though the underlying issues are complex, there were three main problems:
	<ol>
		<li>transparency and auditability — Bitcoin is designed to protect its users' privacy; political contributions need to be tracable to a real person and limit anonymous contributions</li>
		<li>prevention of money laundering, financial exploitation, and legal loopholes — people can abuse Bitcoin "refunds" or contributions between different types of political organizations</li>
		<li>legal and technical catch-22s — Bitcoin intersects campaign finance law in some non-obvious ways</li>
	</ol>
</p>	

<p>The FEC wasn't able to decide on CAF's request. They agreed informally that PACs should in principle be allowed to accept Bitcoins, but couldn't formally agree on <em>how</em>. Nevertheless, some political committees are already accepting Bitcoin, <em>without</em> adequate regulation to ensure transparency etc.</p>

<h2><a href="#aor">Our request</a></h2>

<p>On December 12, 2013 <%= link_to "we", faq_path %> (i.e. MYL C4 &amp; MYL PAC) submitted <a href="/files/MYL%20PAC%20&%20MYL%20C4%20AOR%20re%20Bitcoin%20contributions.pdf" atrget="_blank">our own advisory opinion request about Bitcoin contributions</a> (formally called "AO 2013-20"), proposing a set of rules and accounting requirements which would permit a reasonable treatment of Bitcoins.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of our proposal:
	<ol>
		<li><strong>PACs receiving Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>PACs are only allowed to receive Bitcoins online (i.e. no "physical" Bitcoins), <em>after</em> the contributor provides their information, and only through a "one-time linked address" system that makes it harder to contribute in someone else's name.</li>
				<li>PACs must keep records of Bitcoin-specific transaction details (parallel to the records kept for check or credit card contributions), and only use major, federally registered Bitcoin exchanges.</li>
				<li>PACs can only accept $100 worth of Bitcoin per person per year (just like the limit on attributed contributions of cash, which is also hard to trace).</li>
				<li>Bitcoin contributions may not be refunded under any circumstances (because there are many ways to exploit such "refunds", and with Bitcoin, there's no way to know that it's actually refunded to the same person).</li>
				<li>Some very unusual and/or malicious Bitcoin contributions (e.g. ones that are more expensive to spend than they're worth) aren't counted at all.</li>
				<li>Super PACs have to follow the same rules, and Bitcoin contributions have to be separated the same as any other assets (e.g. for "contribution" vs "independent expenditure" accounts).</li>
				<li>Any Bitcoin contributions that don't meet the accounting standards, or that are suspicious, have to be given to a 501(c)4 or 501(c)3 (which, unlike PACs, are allowed to take totally anonymous contributions and contributions from foreign nationals).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>PACs spending Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>PACs <em>can't</em> spend Bitcoins for solicitation, advertising, polling, transfers, loans, refunds, candidate appearances, or political contributions (including transfers to other PACs).</li>
				<li>PACs <em>can</em> spend Bitcoins for administrative/overhead expenses (including normal transaction fees to anonymous Bitcoin miners), salary, travel, campaign materials, and campaign event expenses (not including payments to candidates).</li>
				<li>PACs can accept merchants' Bitcoin-specific discounts (if they're offered equally to non-political clients).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>501(c)4s receiving/spending Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>501(c)4s can accept <em>completely anonymous</em> Bitcoin contributions, without most of the accounting requirements for PACs.</li>
				<li>501(c)4s can spend Bitcoins on any normal expenses, genuine issue advocacy, etc; just not payments to candidates or contributions to PACs.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2><a href="#c4">Why different treatment for a 501(c)4 and for some types of spending?</a></h2>

<p>A 501(c)4 is only supposed to do "issue advocacy" (e.g. "Yes on Proposition X" type campaigns). Because they're not allowed to affect the election of politicians they're allowed to accept totally anonymous money. By contrast, PACs affect political elections, and are only supposed to do so using money from openly disclosed, US national (or permanent resident) sources.</p>

<p>There's a giant loophole in that system (aka the "501(c)4 to Super PAC money laundering loophole") — which the IRS is <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/29/2013-28492/guidance-for-tax-exempt-social-welfare-organizations-on-candidate-related-political-activities" target="_blank">currently considering closing</a> — and we feel it's especiailly prudent to ensure that contributions that might originate from someone totally anonymous cannot legally be used to influence elections.</p>

<p>We feel that it should be fine for a PAC to use Bitcoin to buy food, pay salaries, and other relatively less sensitive items — but that money spent on advertising, contributions to PACs, etc., ought to go through better regulated, traditional banking channels, which are easier to trace to real people.</p>

<h2><a href="#comment">How you can get involved</a></h2>

<p>We want to know what you think, and the FEC does too.</p>

<p>To tell us informally, just email <a href="mailto:team@makeyourlaws.org?subject=Comments%20on%20bitcoin%20AOR">team@makeyourlaws.org</a>.</p>

<p>To tell the FEC formally, just email <a href="mailto:ao@fec.gov?subject=Comments%20AO%202013-20">ao@fec.gov</a> or fax the FEC's Secretary at +1 (202) 208-3333 and Office of General Counsel at +1 (202) 219-3923.</p>

<p>Make sure to mention the formal name of our request ("AO 2013-20"). Include your name and the name of any organization you represent. Be clear and polite. Explain how you believe Bitcoins should be treated in campaign finance — and why.</p>

<p>If you can, it's better to make a more formal-looking comment. General email comments usually get lumped together, whereas if you take a little extra time to make a good-looking PDF and explain your reasoning in more detail, it'll appear separately and be looked at more seriously. There are no mandatory formatting requirements, but we suggest you use 12 pt Arial w/ 1.5 line spacing for body text; 1 inch margin; and have a header saying "(your [group's] name) comments on AO 2013-20" &amp; the page # / # total pages.</p>
