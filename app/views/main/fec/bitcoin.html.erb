<%= t "Bitcoin contributions to PACs" %>

<div class="flash notice l">Our request is currently in draft form (but should be submitted soon).</div>

<p class="c b"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AVuXrnNPynEcIq07MTgZPCjXMJICxtKeRH0jshYHVk8/" atrget="_blank">Google Doc of our full request</a></p>

<p>In August 2013, Conservative Action Fund PAC (CAF) asked the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) for an advisory opinion request (AOR) about whether they should be permitted to accept contributions of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>We <a href="#caf">commented on that request extensively</a>, raising several issues with it that CAF failed to address. Though the underlying issues are complex, there were three main problems:
	<ol>
		<li>transparency and auditability — Bitcoin is designed to protect its users' privacy; political contributions need to be tracable to a real person and limit anonymous contributions</li>
		<li>prevention of money laundering, financial exploitation, and legal loopholes — people can abuse Bitcoin "refunds" or contributions between different types of political organizations</li>
		<li>legal and technical catch-22s — Bitcoin intersects campaign finance law in some non-obvious ways</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>The FEC wasn't able to decide on CAF's request. They agreed informally that PACs should in principle be allowed to accept Bitcoins, but couldn't formally agree on <em>how</em>. Nevertheless, some political committees are already accepting Bitcoin, <em>without</em> any guidance about how one could obey the law while doing so.</p>

<h2><a href="#aor">Our request</a></h2>

<p>In the near future, <%= link_to "we", faq_path %> (i.e. MYL PAC) are submitting <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AVuXrnNPynEcIq07MTgZPCjXMJICxtKeRH0jshYHVk8/" atrget="_blank">our own advisory opinion request about Bitcoin contributions</a>, proposing our own policy for accepting Bitcoin which we believe would permit a reasonable treatment of Bitcoin contributions and be a good template for others to follow. It <a href="#other">omits a few things</a> that we'd like to address later, for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>Because this is an AOR and not a "rulemaking", we are strictly limited to asking the FEC only "may we, MYL PAC, do this". We can't ask them to impose <em>requirements</em> on other political committees, and what we propose would only be one of (potentially) multiple ways of obeying the law.</p> 

<p>However, if we are successful in getting the FEC's permission for our method, it's likely that other political committees would use our policy, as it would be easier than going through the AOR process all over again themselves.</p>

<p>Here's a summary of our proposal:
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Receiving Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>We will only receive Bitcoins online (i.e. no "physical" Bitcoins), <em>after</em> the contributor provides their information, and only through a "one-time linked address" system that makes it harder to contribute in someone else's name.</li>
				<li>We will keep records of all Bitcoin-specific transaction details (much like the records kept for check or credit card contributions).</li>
				<li>We won't accept any Bitcoins or Bitcoin-derived contributions from any "issue advocacy" (501(c)4) organization.</li>
				<li>Both the "traditional" and "SuperPAC" sides of MYL PAC (which is a "hybrid" SuperPAC) will follow the same rules. Bitcoin contributions will be separated the same as any other assets (e.g. with separate "contribution" vs "independent expenditure" wallets).</li>
				<li>We will refund Bitcoins in USD only, for contributors who have identified themselves to us. (Our request <a href="#other">doesn't address</a> anonymous contributions.)</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Spending Bitcoin</strong>
			<ol>
				<li>We <em>won't</em> spend Bitcoins for solicitation, advertising, polling, transfers, loans, refunds, candidate appearances, or political contributions (including transfers to other PACs).</li>
				<li>We <em>will</em> spend Bitcoins for administrative/overhead expenses (including normal transaction fees to anonymous Bitcoin miners), salary, travel, campaign materials, and campaign event expenses (not including payments to candidates).</li>
				<li>We will accept merchants' Bitcoin-specific discounts (if they're offered equally to non-political clients).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h2><a href="#c4">Why different treatment for some types of spending and contributions?</a></h2>

<p>A 501(c)4 is only supposed to do "issue advocacy" (e.g. "Yes on Proposition X" type campaigns). Because they're not allowed to affect the election of politicians they're allowed to accept totally anonymous money. By contrast, PACs affect political elections, and are only supposed to do so using money from openly disclosed, US national (or permanent resident) sources.</p>

<p>There's currently a giant loophole in that system (aka the "501(c)4 to Super PAC money laundering loophole") — which the IRS is <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/11/29/2013-28492/guidance-for-tax-exempt-social-welfare-organizations-on-candidate-related-political-activities" target="_blank">currently considering closing</a> — and we feel it's especiailly prudent to ensure that contributions that might originate from someone totally anonymous cannot legally be used to influence elections.</p>

<p>We feel that it should be fine for a PAC to use Bitcoin to buy food, pay salaries, and other relatively less sensitive items — but that money spent on advertising, contributions to PACs, etc., ought to go through better regulated, traditional banking channels, which are easier to trace to real people.</p>

<a name="other"></a>
<h2><a href="#other">What we <em>didn't</em> cover</a></h2>

<p>In order to simplify this request (and have it more likely to be approved), we decided <em>not</em> to include a specific things that we'd like to see addressed:</p>

<ol>
	<li>We believe that PACs should only be allowed to accept $100 worth of Bitcoin per person per year. This is currently true of cash donations, but of course Congress didn't anticipate Bitcoin back in 1980 when it last amended the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/2/441g">underlying law</a>. We believe the <em>intent</em> of that law was to limit contributions that are <em>hard to trace</em> (which includes both cash and Bitcoin).</li>
	<li>We believe that Bitcoin contributions that don't meet the accounting standards, or that are suspicious, should be given to the US Treasury or to a 501(c)4 or 501(c)3 (which, unlike PACs, are allowed to take totally anonymous contributions and contributions from foreign nationals). Current FEC regulations, however, require even clearly illegal contributions to be returned to the contributor. We have some serious doubts about whether this is even <em>possible</em> to do reliably with Bitcoin.</li>
	<li>It is technologically impossible to prevent totally anonymous Bitcoin users from sending us Bitcoins <em>outside</em> of our system for getting information on contributors, and we believe that there should be guidance for how to handle this situation.</li>
	<li>We believe that 501(c)4s can accept <em>completely anonymous</em> Bitcoin contributions, and spend them freely, so long as it's only used for genuine issue advocacy and <em>never</em>, directly or indirectly, used to influence the election of any politician.</li>
	<li>We believe that some unusual and/or malicious Bitcoin contributions (e.g. ones that are more expensive to spend than they're worth) shouldn't be counted at all.</li>
</ol>

<p>We intend to raise some of these issues in a future AOR once we have a specific situation to address (e.g. if we receive an unwanted anonymous Bitcoin contribution which we have no way of reliably refunding to its original owner).</p>

<p>Some (like refunds or a cap on the total amount given) <em>might</em> require changes to the regulations or law. We don't yet know, and we intend to wait until after we have at least a basic proposal approved before addressing those issues.</p>

<h2><a href="#comment">How you can get involved</a></h2>

<p>We want to know what you think, and the FEC does too.</p>

<p>To tell us informally, just email <a href="mailto:team@makeyourlaws.org?subject=Comments%20on%20bitcoin%20AOR">team@makeyourlaws.org</a> or comment on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AVuXrnNPynEcIq07MTgZPCjXMJICxtKeRH0jshYHVk8/">Google doc</a>.</p>

<p>Once we submit our request, you'll also be email the FEC with your formal comments.</p>

<p>If you <%= link_to "create an account", signup_path %> on this website, we'll let you know when that happens. (You won't be able to do anything else yet, since we're not yet launched, but we'll also let you know when we launch.)</p>


<!-- <p>To tell the FEC formally, just email <a href="mailto:ao@fec.gov?subject=Comments%20AO%202013-20">ao@fec.gov</a> or fax the FEC's Secretary at +1 (202) 208-3333 and Office of General Counsel at +1 (202) 219-3923.</p>

<p>Make sure to mention the formal name of our request ("AO 2013-20"). Include your name and the name of any organization you represent. Be clear and polite. Explain how you believe Bitcoins should be treated in campaign finance — and why.</p>

<p>If you can, it's better to make a more formal-looking comment. General email comments usually get lumped together, whereas if you take a little extra time to make a good-looking PDF and explain your reasoning in more detail, it'll appear separately and be looked at more seriously. There are no mandatory formatting requirements, but we suggest you use 12 pt Arial w/ 1.5 line spacing for body text; 1 inch margin; and have a header saying "(your [group's] name) comments on AO 2013-20" &amp; the page # / # total pages.</p> -->
