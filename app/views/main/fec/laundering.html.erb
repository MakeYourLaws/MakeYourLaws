<p>Current FEC and IRS regulations permit political committees with independent expenditure accounts ("Super PACs") to receive contributions from 501(c)(4) "social welfare" corporations — which themselves have no public reporting obligations.</p>

<p>This hole in the regulations, combined with recent Supreme Court court decisions, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/faq.php">has made it easy</a> for unlimited, completely anonymous, potentially foreign-sourced money to be used to influence U.S. elections. In the 2012 federal election cycle, this "dark money" <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/outsidespending/nonprof_summ.php">totaled roughly $257 million</a>. It's estimated to be much higher in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>In effect, this is money laundering for political contributions ("contribution laundering").</p>

<p>We believe that this plainly subverts the purpose of our campaign finance laws, as well as the  assumptions of public disclosure relied on by our courts.</p>

<p>Though recent court decisions have allowed corporations to purchase political speech through "independent expenditures", this right does not extend to the purchase of <em>anonymous</em> speech.</p>

<br/>
<p>Our proposal to cure this problem is simple and very narrowly tailored: we are asking the FEC to require that any corporation contributing more than $1k/yr to influence elections do so through a publicly reported bank account (known as an "SSF" or "<em>Carey</em> account") — and that all reporting disclose not just the last hop in what is potentially a chain of shell corporations, but also the <em>original</em>, human contributor.</p>

<p>This would <em>not</em> require issue advocacy organizations to disclose donors for their issue advocacy spending. That remains private. This <em>only</em> affects money used to influence an election.</p>
