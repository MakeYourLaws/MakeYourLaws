<p>In August 2013, the Conservative Action Fund PAC (CAF) asked the Federal Election Commission whether they should be permitted to accept contributions of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>We commented on that request extensively, raising several issues with it that CAF failed to address. Though the underlying issues are complex, there were three main problems:
	<ol>
		<p>transparency and auditability — Bitcoin is designed to protect its users' privacy; political contributions need to be traceable to a real person and limit anonymous contributions</p>
		<p>prevention of money laundering, financial exploitation, and legal loopholes — people can abuse Bitcoin "refunds" or contributions between different types of political organizations</p>
		<p>legal and technical catch-22s — Bitcoin intersects campaign finance law in some non-obvious ways</p>
	</ol>
</p>

<p>The FEC wasn't able to decide on CAF's request. They agreed informally that PACs should in principle be allowed to accept Bitcoins, but couldn't formally agree on <em>how</em>. Nevertheless, some political committees are already accepting Bitcoin, <em>without</em> any guidance about how one could obey the law while doing so.</p>

<p>On February 10<sup>th</sup> 2014, we submitted <%= link_to "our own advisory opinion request (AOR)", fec_bitcoin_path %>, proposing how we intend to accept Bitcoins.</p>
