# If you are running exim4-daemon-heavy or a custom version of Exim that
# was compiled with the content-scanning extension, you can cause incoming
# messages to be automatically scanned for viruses. You have to modify the
# configuration in two places to set this up. The first of them is here,
# where you define the interface to your scanner. This example is typical
# for ClamAV; see the manual for details of what to set for other virus
# scanners. The second modification is in the acl_check_data access
# control list.

# For spam scanning, there is a similar option that defines the interface to
# SpamAssassin. You do not need to set this if you are using the default, which
# is shown in this commented example. As for virus scanning, you must also
# modify the acl_check_data access control list to enable spam scanning.

# where the domain part is a "domain literal" (an IP address) instead
# of a named domain. The RFCs require this facility, but it is disabled
# in the default config since it is seldomly used and frequently abused.
# Domain literal support also needs a special router, which is automatically
# enabled if you use the enable macro MAIN_ALLOW_DOMAIN_LITERALS.
# Additionally, you might want to make your local IP addresses (or @[])
# local domains.

# The settings below, which are actually the same as the defaults in the

# calls. You can limit the hosts to which these calls are made, and/or change
# the timeout that is used. If you set the timeout to zero, all RFC 1413 calls
# are disabled. RFC 1413 calls are cheap and can provide useful information
# for tracing problem messages, but some hosts and firewalls are
# misconfigured to drop the requests instead of either answering or
# rejecting them. This can result in a timeout instead of an immediate refused
# connection, leading to delays on starting up SMTP sessions. (The default was

# submitted message are not removed, and no automatic Sender: headers
